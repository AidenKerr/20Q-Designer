# Raycast Renderer & Level Editor

## Proposal

This application will be a level editor with ray cast rendering.
Users can use this application to build worlds for their own games.
They will be able to add straight walls, as well as different types of curved walls.
*Functionality may be added later for different colours, as well as doors that can open with a key.*

This project is of interest to me because I find ray casting to be fascinating, and I want to write it on my own.

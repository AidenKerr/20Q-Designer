<img align="right" alt="20Q game" src="./data/20q.png" width="450px">

This application is a *20Q* style game builder.
This application can be used to build custom games of 20 questions. You can add items, and answer yes
and no questions about them to place them on a binary tree. After, another player can think of an item, answer
the questions, and the program will guess what it is!

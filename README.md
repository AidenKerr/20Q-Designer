# Raycast Renderer & Level Editor

## Proposal

This application will be a level editor with ray cast rendering.
Users can use this application to build worlds for their own games.
They will be able to add straight walls, as well as different types of curved walls.
*Functionality may be added later for different colours, as well as doors that can open with a key.*

This project is of interest to me because I find ray casting to be fascinating, and I want to write it on my own.  

### User Stories

1) As a user, I want to be able to create a wall at a certain location and add it to the list of walls.
2) As a user, I want to be able to view the list of walls.
3) As a user, I want to be able to delete a wall from my list of walls.
4) As a user, I want to be able to change the direction of my character.
5) As a user, I want ot be able to move my character forwards or backwards.
